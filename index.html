      <h1><strong><i>Tori Olley, MSW, LCSW-C, LCSW, CSM </i></strong></h1> 

        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p1>
            I am a mental health clinician, licensed in the Maryland and Texas. I was first exposed to software applications
            when I worked as an Analyst/Consultant for a leading Electronic Medical Records system on several
            implementations. This gave me the opportunity to work with other programs which were integrated with the EMR I
            was working with. I found myself intrigued by computer systems and how a string of alphanumeric data could be so
            powerful.
            While managing projects, I am always captivated by the expertise of developers and their ability to translate
            everyday needs into program functionality. In a bid to understand the granular details that come with
            programming, I decided to enroll in a six-month bootcamp. While I continue to run a small private practice, I
            believe that a healthy understanding of programming language could make me a better clinician. The attention to
            detail is a skill required and possessed by programmers and clinicians alike.
