                        <h2> About Me</h2>
                        <p1>
                            I am a mental health clinician, licensed in the Maryland and Texas. I was first exposed to
                            software applications
                            when I worked as an Analyst/Consultant for a leading Electronic Medical Records system on
                            several
                            implementations. This gave me the opportunity to work with other programs which were
                            integrated with the EMR I
                            was working with. I found myself intrigued by computer systems and how a string of
                            alphanumeric data could be so
                            powerful.
                            While managing projects, I am always captivated by the expertise of developers and their
                            ability to translate
                            everyday needs into program functionality. In a bid to understand the granular details that
                            come with
                            programming, I decided to enroll in a six-month bootcamp. While I continue to run a small
                            private practice, I
                            believe that a healthy understanding of programming language could make me a better
                            clinician. The attention to
                            detail is a skill required and possessed by programmers and clinicians alike.
